Iris Flower Classification Project

Overview
This project demonstrates a classic machine learning task: Iris Flower Classification using various algorithms including k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Features
Implementations of k-NN and SVM classifiers for iris classification.
Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.
Evaluation of model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1) Setup Environment:

Install necessary libraries:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

2) Run Jupyter Notebook

Project Structure
a) iris_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
b) README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
c) requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies for easy installation.

Usage
a) Open iris_classification.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
b) Follow the step-by-step instructions to explore data, train models, and evaluate performance.
c) Modify or extend the project as needed for your own experiments.

Results
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): 
Accuracy: 100%
Confusion Matrix:[[19  0  0]
 [ 0 13  0]
 [ 0  0 13]]
 
Classification Report: Precision, recall, F1-score for each class
